#### Barcode Battle
The BARCODIANS have arrived!  These enigmatic beings, disguised as barcodes on everyday products, possess incredible abilities. Now, it's your turn to harness their power. Enter the code, unleash the warrior, and prepare for battle!
#### DeLorean Dash
Great Scott! Biff's gone rogue and messed with the space-time continuum. Again! Doc is frantic, his hair even more wild than usual. Apparently, Biff hopped in the DeLorean and hid crucial items from different time periods, rewriting history for his own nefarious ends. 

The good news? You, Marty McFly, are on the case. Doc's rigged the DeLorean for short time jumps, but there's a catch: in each era, Biff's left a trail of chaos – a sleek stallion in 1885, a souped-up hot rod in 1955, Marty’s dream pickup in 1985 and a tricked-out hoverboard in 2015 – and you gotta race them all to get the stolen items back. Buckle up McFly - it's time to hit the gas and set history straight, one time warp at a time!
#### Minesweeper
This is a faithful recreation of Minesweeper for the ZX Spectrum, with the look and feel of the Windows 3.1 original. This classic game of logic and deduction challenges you to navigate a minefield by uncovering hidden squares. Press ‘U’ to uncover a square. If it's a mine, you lose! If it's a number, it indicates how many mines are adjacent to that square. Press ‘M’ to mark a suspected mine. Uncover all the safe squares to win!

#### ZX Stock Exchange
It is July 1982. Welcome to the frenetic trading floor of the ZX Stock Exchange. The air crackles with the buzz of hurried transactions and the staccato rhythm of the ticker tape. In this game you'll test your financial acumen in the heart of the City, where fortunes are won and lost in the blink of an eye. Can you navigate the volatile markets, buy low, sell high, and amass a fortune? Or will the unpredictable tides of the market leave you penniless? Only your wits and a touch of luck will determine your fate in this 8-bit financial adventure.

#### Ten Liner Counter
I've been enjoying taking part in the BASIC 10 Liner contests for the last few years. But one thing that has been quite time consuming is checking whether each line of your BASIC program meets the limits of the competition (80, 120 or 256 characters depending on the category). Other computers store their commands as one byte one character (e.g. Commodore 64) so counting is really easy - just look at the number of lines on the screen. But Sinclair BASIC is tokenised, meaning that commands like 'RANDOMIZE' or 'IF' both only take up one character. I ended up counting them by hand. Until I decided to do something to automate the process...
#### TinyBasic
Ever tried writing a BASIC interpreter inside a BASIC interpreter? No? Well, I've done it for you. And not just any BASIC interpreter, but one crammed into a mere ten lines that is a love letter to the early hobbyist pioneers from the 1970s. Prepare for TinyBasic, a testament to the absurd, the impractical, and the strangely compelling. Brace yourselves.

#### Hardware Hustle
Buy, make, sell, and research your way to profit without burning out!

Hardware Hustle is a really fun turn-based resource management game that simulates the running of a small hardware business over 6 days. You'll be buying parts, making and selling widgets, researching and improving each part of the business, trying to make as much money as possible. The game board for each day resembles a spreadsheet from the 1980s (including the green-on-black text aesthetic).
#### ZXFM
ZXFM is a football management simulator for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum written in just 10 lines of BASIC! Play an entire season as manager of a team from your favourite league, or create your own leagues and teams. Manage injuries, buy and sell in the transfer market and save your progress to tape or disk as you go along. ZXFM was inspired by the original 1982 "Football Manager" game by Kevin Toms (which was also written in BASIC but used over 700 lines of code!)
